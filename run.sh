# Simple DX wrapper around docker compose for Oktosync.
# Usage:
#   ./run.sh up         # build + start in background (creates secret if missing)
#   ./run.sh down       # stop stack (keeps volumes)
#   ./run.sh destroy    # stop and remove volumes and images
#   ./run.sh logs       # tail logs
#   ./run.sh ps         # show containers
#
# Env:
#   PORT (default: 3000)    -> host/container port for server
#   COMPOSE_FILE (optional) -> defaults to docker-compose.yml
